## What is Tidy Data?

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

-   Each variable must have its own column.
-   Each observation must have its own row.
-   Each value must have its own cell.

## The benefits of R

![](tidy-1.png)

## Needed packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
```

## Importing data

```{r non-tidy-stocks, echo=FALSE}
stocks <- tibble(
  Date = as.Date("2009-01-01") + 0:4,
  `Boeing stock price` = paste("$", c("173.55", "172.61", "173.86", "170.77", "174.29"), sep = ""),
  `Amazon stock price` = paste("$", c("174.90", "171.42", "171.58", "173.89", "170.16"), sep = ""),
  `Google stock price` = paste("$", c("174.34", "170.04", "173.65", "174.87", "172.19"), sep = "")
) %>% print()
```

## Importing data

```{r tidy-stocks, echo=FALSE}
stocks_tidy <- stocks |>
  rename(
    Boeing = `Boeing stock price`,
    Amazon = `Amazon stock price`,
    Google = `Google stock price`
  ) |>
  #  gather(`Stock name`, `Stock price`, -Date)
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Date,
    names_to = "Stock Name",
    values_to = "Stock Price"
  )%>% print()

```

## Importing data

:::: {.absolute top="0" left="100%"}
::: sectionhead
1 [2 3 4 5 6]{style="opacity:0.25"}

My personal Excel nightmare

. . .

The magic of R is that it's [**reproducible**]{style="color:#cc0000"} (by someone else *or* by yourself in six months)

. . .

Keeps data separate from code (data preparation steps)

# Basic data manipulation

:::: {.absolute top="0" left="100%"}
::: sectionhead
[1]{style="opacity:0.25"} 2 [3 4 5 6]{style="opacity:0.25"}
