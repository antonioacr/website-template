I am an Assistant Professor at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora with a PhD in Business Administration from the Federal University of Minas Gerais. I specialize in Supply Chain. I also work as a consultant, helping businesses optimize their performance. Outside of work, I’m a dedicated runner and have completed two marathons. I enjoy taking care of my plants, experimenting with cocktail recipes, and relaxing with my dachshund, Heinz.
